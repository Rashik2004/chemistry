        <h3 id="headline">How Geothermal Energy Works</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Heat Sources</strong><br> The Earth's interior contains heat from various sources, including the decay of radioactive materials and the residual heat from the Earth's formation.<br>
            <strong>Geothermal Reservoirs</strong> <br>These are areas beneath the Earth's surface where high temperatures and pressure cause rocks to hold significant amounts of heat. These reservoirs can be found relatively close to the surface or deeper underground. <br>
            <strong>Extraction</strong>Geothermal energy is extracted by tapping into these reservoirs through wells. Water or steam is brought to the surface through these wells to utilize the heat for various purposes. <br>
            <strong>Power Generation</strong> <br>The extracted hot water or steam is used to drive turbines connected to generators, producing electricity. This process is similar to how other thermal power plants, such as those using fossil fuels or nuclear energy, generate electricity.
          </li>
          
          <li>
            <strong>Types of Geothermal Power</strong> <br><br>
            <strong>Geothermal Power Plants</strong> <br>These plants directly utilize the heat from underground reservoirs to generate electricity.  <br>
              <ul>
                <li> <strong>Dry Steam Plants</strong> <br>Use steam from the reservoir to directly drive turbines.</li>
                <li> <strong>Flash Steam Plants</strong> <br>High-pressure hot water from the reservoir is flashed into steam to power turbines.</li>
                <li> <strong>Binary Cycle Plants</strong> <br>Heat from the reservoir is used to vaporize a secondary fluid with a lower boiling point, which then drives turbines.</li>
              </ul>
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Direct Use Applications</strong> <br>Geothermal energy is not only used for electricity generation but also for direct applications such as heating buildings, greenhouses, and spas. In these cases, hot water from geothermal reservoirs is used directly without being converted into electricity.<br>
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Advantages of Geothermal Energy</strong> <br><br> 
            <strong>Renewable and Reliable</strong><br>
            Geothermal energy is a constant and renewable energy source, available 24/7 without being affected by weather conditions.<br>
            <strong>Low Emissions</strong> <br>
            Compared to fossil fuels, geothermal power plants produce minimal greenhouse gas emissions.<br>
            <strong>Versatility</strong> <br>
            It can be used for electricity generation as well as direct heating applications.<br> 
          </li> 
          <li>
            <strong>Challenges and Considerations</strong> <br> <br>
            <strong>Location Dependence</strong> <br>Geothermal resources are limited to specific geographic areas with suitable geological conditions.<br>
            <strong>Initial Costs</strong> <br>Developing geothermal projects, especially drilling wells and setting up power plants, can have high initial costs. <br>
            Overall, geothermal energy is a sustainable and reliable source of clean power, offering both electricity generation and direct heating applications, but its widespread use might be constrained by geographical limitations and upfront investment requirements. Continued technological advancements may help overcome these challenges and expand the utilization of geothermal energy.
